# MajorProject

Major Project - Machine Learning Agents in Unity3D - Research.

## Project Diary

Set of notes divided in two sections

### Weekly

Collection of notes displaying the weekly progress of the development.

### Observations

Collection of notes describing the observed behaviour and efficiency of the trained models. They also contain information on what changes were made to the environment and hyperparameters before conducting the experiment.

## Builds

Builds are Unity WebGL applications using the trained model.

Read Builds/README.md for instructions on how to run them.

## Results

Contains all of the trained models for application and view of the training summary in TensorBoard.

## Statistical Tests

Contains a statistical script created for comparison of the results of repeated experiment (e.g., Cumulative Reward) to determine whether the experiment is replicable.
