# Monday
## Daily Scrum:
### Achieved since the last session:
- Run a new experiment thrice to evaluate the replicability:
	- Irreplicable, each training gave a different result.
	- Behaviour in the experiment #64 was quite interesting: hiding strategy developed by Prey.
	- Environment overfitting - not usable for the realistic environment.
- Achieved a serious progress on writing the report.
### To be achieved today:
- Carry on with the report.
- Make a script to initialise the conda environment with all the packages.
- Make a script to run the local server for offline build runs.

# Tuesday:
## Daily Scrum:
### Achieved since yesterday:
- Both scripts created.
- More report sections completed.
### To be achieved today:
- Run the statistical test (T-test) on Cumulative Reward and Entropy, etc., to support the replicability evidence.
- Carry on writing the report.
- Prepare the software design to explain the structure in the report.
- Have at list a partially complete report for the Supervisor's review.
### Obstacles:
- Realistically, two days left with still a lot to do.
