# Tuesday
### Daily Scrum:
#### Accomplished yesterday:
- Read more on the ml-agents source code, revised some definitions
- Trained two new models with different rewards and one with more observations
#### To accomplish today:
- Prepare some organisational slides for the presentation: explanation of the model inner workings, how the model actually trains, what usually are the inputs and the outputs (on the latest model)
