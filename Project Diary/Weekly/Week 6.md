# Monday
### Daily Scrum:
#### Accomplished yesterday:
- Moved and formatted the Research Questions to Obsidian Vault.
#### To accomplish today:
- Make sure the observations from last week have all the metrics required.
- Change the reward system and test in both environments.
- Check if recent disabling of wind and motion features improved the realistic environment computational time and try to optimise if not.
- Make observations.
- Explore with automation script to automate the production of plot images and data capturing.

#### Obstacles met:
- Training time in the "realistic" environment is quite long and visible observations are almost impossible.
