# Tuesday
### Daily Scrum:
#### Accomplished since last Scrum:
- Partially completed the observations - confused by some of the results.
#### To accomplish today:
- Create Curriculum, things to consider:
	- Learning how to spot objects?
	- Learning how to move around - explore?
	- Agent-Specific roles - separate but within single environment?
#### Obstacles:
- Curriculum may take a lot longer to train properly.
- Hard to distinguish the 'actions' that should be learned at first:
	- Could be impossible to train with two agents - more reading required.
# Wednesday
### Daily Scrum:
#### Accomplished yesterday:
- Considered which lessons would be needed for a curriculum.
- Run training again to see if the setup is stable.
#### To accomplish today:
- Go through the code and see how to improve Prey Controller.
#### Obstacles:
- Curriculum might require complete remodelling of the code created.
# Thursday
### Daily Scrum:
#### Accomplished yesterday:
- Run some trainings with changed rewards - prey now has more observations.
#### To accomplish today:
- Run training in the realistic environment.
- Run training with more hunger time for Predator.

# Friday
### Daily Scrum:
#### Accomplished yesterday:
- Run training in the realistic environment after disabling sphere cast.
- Run more trainings, newer ones with no sphere casts too.
- Fix Hunter's model to not interfere with its' ray sensor.
#### To accomplish today:
- Test sphere casts more after unsuccessful trainings.
- Make observations for recent trainings.
#### Obstacles:
- Sphere casts are too expensive to run in the realistic environments.
- Lack of Sphere Casts completely ruin the training - curriculum lesson could solve that.
