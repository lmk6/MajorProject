# Monday
### Daily Scrum:
#### Accomplished end of last week:
- Tested few reward changes.
#### To accomplish today:
- Do some more testing along with change of hyperparameters. Perhaps some state-based rewards are needed (single big reward for spotting the target).
#### Obstacles:
- It is quite hard to design a proper reward system that enforces a correct behaviour.
# Tuesday
