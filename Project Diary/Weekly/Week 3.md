After few failures and an instability met from the drivers, second installation of Ubuntu.
Tackling further issues with the drivers. Doing a thorough research on using ROCm to emulate the use of CUDA and Tensor on AMD GPU.
Installation of Unity3D - Unity ver 2022.3.19f1.
Installation of ROCm drivers and a tailored PyTorch: 2.3.0.dev20240215+rocm6.0.
Testing PyTorch and ROCm, setting up the linux environment to automate the change of environment variables and run of the python venv.
Created a first working 3D model using Unity3D ML-agents.
Research on what are and how to formulate research questions - I saw a few research papers and tutorials and formulated a list of questions I would like my project to answer.
Spent the weekend on learning about Camera Vision and RayCasting in Unity3D for training.
